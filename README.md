# Weather App - Homework 6

### Description

For this homework, I built a weather app that hooks into OpenWeatherMap's API to fetch current weather conditions for whatever city is entered as search criteria. When the user clicks "Get Weather", then they are shown the Current Conditions container, which displays the city, a country code (or flag emoji if supported), the date and time in the city's local timezone, the weather conditions with an icon, the relative humidity, and the wind speed.

When the user clicks "View 5-Day Forecast", then they are shown a new container with 5 columns for each of the next five days. The days are displayed using the day of the week, and are responsive to the location's timezone, i.e. if the current day in Sydney is Wednesday, then Day 1 of the five-day forecast will be Thursday.

When the user views each card in the forecast, they are presented with the forecasted high temperature, the forecasted conditions with an icon, the forecasted humidity, wind speed, and UV Index.

When the user searches for each city, it is then saved at the top of the page as a recent search.
